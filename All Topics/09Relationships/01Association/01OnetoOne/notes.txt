/* 
 * KEY CONCEPTS - One-to-One Association:
 * 
 * 1. ASSOCIATION: Students class "HAS-A" Passport (composition/aggregation)
 *    - Students class contains a reference to a Passport object
 * 
 * 2. ONE-TO-ONE RELATIONSHIP:
 *    - One Student object is associated with exactly ONE Passport object
 *    - One Passport object is associated with exactly ONE Student object
 *    - This models real-world relationship: each student has one passport
 * 
 * 3. CARDINALITY: 1:1 (one-to-one)
 *    Student [1] ←→ [1] Passport
 * 
 * 4. DEPENDENCY: Student depends on Passport to get passport information
 *    - Student uses Passport's getPassportNumber() method
 * 
 * 5. OBJECT COLLABORATION: Two objects working together
 *    - Students object collaborates with Passport object
 *    - They maintain their own data but are connected through association
 * 
 * Real-world analogy:
 * - Just like in real life, one person has one passport
 * - The passport belongs to that specific person
 * - You can't have multiple passports (in this simple model)
 * - The passport can't belong to multiple people
