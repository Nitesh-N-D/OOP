/* 
 * KEY CONCEPTS - One-to-Many Association:
 * 
 * 1. ONE-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIP:
 *    - ONE Teacher is associated with MANY Students
 *    - ONE Classroom has ONE Teacher but MANY Students
 *    - Cardinality: Teacher [1] ←→ [*] Student (1 to many)
 * 
 * 2. MULTIPLICITY:
 *    - "One" side: Single object reference (Teacher teacher)
 *    - "Many" side: Collection/Array (Student[] students)
 * 
 * 3. REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:
 *    - One teacher teaches many students in a classroom
 *    - One teacher can have 20, 30, or more students
 *    - But all those students have the same one teacher (in this class)
 * 
 * 4. COLLECTION USAGE:
 *    - Array is used to store multiple Student objects
 *    - Could also use ArrayList, List, etc. for dynamic sizing
 * 
 * 5. VISUAL REPRESENTATION:
 * 
 *         ┌──────────────┐
 *         │   Teacher    │
 *         │ "Dr. Smith"  │
 *         └──────┬───────┘
 *                │
 *                │ teaches (1:*)
 *                │
 *        ┌───────┴───────┬───────┬───────┐
 *        │               │       │       │
 *        ▼               ▼       ▼       ▼
 *   ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐
 *   │Student  │    │Student  │ │Student  │ │Student  │
 *   │ Alice   │    │  Bob    │ │ Charlie │ │ Diana   │
 *   │ Roll:101│    │ Roll:102│ │ Roll:103│ │ Roll:104│
 *   └─────────┘    └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
 * 
 * COMPARISON with One-to-One (Passport example):
 * - One-to-One:  One Student ←→ One Passport
 * - One-to-Many: One Teacher ←→ Many Students
