OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm where we structure programs around objects, which combine data (attributes or fields) and behavior (methods or functions) into a single unit.

Instead of only thinking in terms of variables and functions separately, in OOP we treat things as objects that represent real-world or conceptual entities — each with:

State → stored in attributes (variables inside the object)

Behavior → implemented through methods (functions bound to the object)

Core principles of OOP:

Encapsulation → bundling data and methods together, controlling access.

Abstraction → hiding unnecessary implementation details, exposing only what’s needed.

Inheritance → allowing new classes to be based on existing ones, reusing and extending code.

Polymorphism → the ability for different objects to be used interchangeably if they share a common interface.

A cleaner definition could be:

OOP is a programming paradigm where programs are built using objects — self-contained units of state and behavior — to model and solve problems in a way that mirrors real-world concepts.
