## Concepts Covered

- **Classes & Objects** — Defining types and creating instances
- **Inheritance** — Reusing and extending behavior through parent-child relationships
- **Polymorphism** — Same interface, different behavior (overloading, overriding)
- **Encapsulation** — Hiding internal state and exposing controlled access
- **Abstraction & Interfaces** — Focusing on what objects do, not how they do it

## Help Wanted

Contributions that would be especially helpful:

- **More examples** — Extra code samples for existing topics or new subtopics
- **New exercises** — Small projects or problems that reinforce OOP concepts
- **Diagrams** — UML or simple diagrams (e.g. class diagrams, relationship sketches)
